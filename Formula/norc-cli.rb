    <<~EOS
      Run `norc pair` to connect this machine to your norc account.

      Before running `brew uninstall norc-cli`, run `norc service uninstall`
      first — Homebrew formulas have no uninstall hook, so this won't happen
      automatically and a stale LaunchAgent would otherwise be left behind.
